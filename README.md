Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools into the development and maintenance of high quality software systems.
Software engineering plays an important role in technology industry by enabling the development of software application that is pivotal in healthcare, agriculture, commerce, entertainment etc.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
The advent of structured programming in the 1970s
The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirement: it involves gathering and documenting user need and system requirements
Design: it involves creating high level and detailed design of the software architecture and user interface
Implementation: It involves writing the code and building the software according to the design specifications
Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements
Deployment: This step involves releasing the software to users or customers
Maintenance: it involves providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology involves a sequential approach with distinct phases( e.g. requirements, design, implementation),flowing downward like a waterfall. Agile methodology is an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Sofware developer: responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions
Quality assurance engineer: ensures software quality by designing and executing test plan
Project manager: oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated development environments is important because its a software suite that provides comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing codes. example visual studio, eclipse, intellij IDEA , while version control systems is important because it is a software tool for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members. example Git, Subversion

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Some of the challenges faced by software engineers are changing requirements, tight deadlines technical debts. The strategies for overcoming these challenges are effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing: it involves testing individual components or module of software
Integration testing:  it involves testing interaction between different components or subsystems
System testing: testing the entire software system as a whole
Acceptance testing: it involves testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt enginnering can be defined as the process of crafting questions or statements to get the best possible response from AI models.
prompt engineering is important because it helps to make our question clear and specific, so AI understands exactly what we need.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
example of a vague prompt is "Tell me about Nigeria" while the improved prompt is "Tell me about the history of Nigeria culture". 
The improved prompt is more effective because we wil get a focused answer.
